# Python Codes
An archive of the Python codes I've written for practice while learning Python. Pushing codes daily into this repo made my GitHub profile look green on those days when I didn't contribute to open source projects. It's a silly excuse but any excuse will do if it is going to motivate you to write more code!

## Contribute to this repo!

Practice makes perfect! Help me practice by creating new issues giving me a practice problem to be solved in Python. A few rules are -

* One practice problem per issue.
* The practice problem should be solvable in 10-15 mins max.
* Better if it covers more Python constructs.

So creating an issue will make your GitHub profile green and will give me a practice problem to solve.

You can also contribute by solving existing issues. That's right! If there's an open issue regarding a practice problem feel free to submit a PR with python code to solve it! Reviewing your code is also a kind of practice! It'll be cool if you can solve the practice problem using latest cool Python constructs. A few rules about PR and code quality -

* One PR per issue only.
* Please write meaningful variable names. Remember your code will be read by someone else.
* At the beginning of your code, please mention your name and give a link to your GitHub profile in comments.

You don't have to be creative in posting practice problems. Take a book and look at those exercises! Post issues and let us practice together so that we can rule Python someday! And don't be shy to submit PRs for the issues created by you itself! The goal of this repo is to make you write code!

## Resources

I learnt Python from a course [Introduction to Programming in Python](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/introduction-to-programming-with-python-8360) in Microsoft [Virtual Academy (MVA)](http://mva.microsoft.com/). It was a very introductory and slow-paced course but a nice one!
