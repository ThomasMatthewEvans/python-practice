# Python Codes
An archive of the Python codes I've written when learning the language. Making a repository of my python codes and pushing my daily practice codes motivated me to write codes daily and that's how you learn any programming language, by writing a lot of code.

## Resources

I learnt Python from a course [Introduction to Programming in Python](https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/introduction-to-programming-with-python-8360) in Microsoft [Virtual Academy (MVA)](http://mva.microsoft.com/). It was a very introductory and slow-paced course but a nice one!
